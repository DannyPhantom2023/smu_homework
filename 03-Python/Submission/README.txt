In this assignment we were set with two tasks, the first was to find a way with the CSV file given to us to find a code that would allow the viewer to run the results of the statistical analysis of the financial records of the company in a storytelling perspective to the viewer. The second task the coding had to be more in depth due to this one needing to have individual candidates with stats of their amount of votes, which helps the audience get an idea on how great (or poorly) each candidate peformed. To be able to run these coding properly make sure to open the 'Starter_Code' folder inside visual studio, so the csv files will be next to the coding and will run.
