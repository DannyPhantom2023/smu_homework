In this assignment we had to analyze stock market data using VBA, just like in real-world situations we will have too many analytics that would take too long with just regular Excel, so we use programming software such as VBA to analyze big sizes of data. There are two Excel files in this folder. The multiple-year stock data is the main data that our focus will be on, however, when it comes to programming it is best to test in small proportions before we fill out the entire sheet. This is where the alphabetical testing comes in, the numbers are the same, but it doesn't have much of them like the main one, this is so we can test if our code will work in small proportions, as well as throughout the entire sheet. Once we give it numerous tests and it runs successfully, we transfer the code over to the main file. This assignment shows how if you have the proper coding the data can change every day but since we did the right steps in our code we will always end up with the proper results.
